Additional extension-related files to manually delete:

ROOT DIRECTORY:
- EXTENSION_DASHBOARD_CONNECTION.md
- EXTENSION_STATUS.md  
- EXTENSION_TROUBLESHOOTING_CHECKLIST.md

DASHBOARD DIRECTORY:
- debug-step-by-step.bat (if it contains extension references)
- DELETE_EXTENSION_FILES.txt (after you've used it)

These files are no longer needed since the browser extension has been removed from the project.
